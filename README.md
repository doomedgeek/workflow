hi , its a toturial
CI/CD 
github actions


Welcome t project! This project is built using Node.js and is hosted on GitHub. In this project, we have a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and tests our code on every push to the main branch.
Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/doomedgeek/workflow.git        



Once you have the repository cloned to your local machine, you can install the dependencies:

cd my-awesome-project
npm install




Usage

To use this project, simply make changes to the code and push to the main branch. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and test your changes, and if everything is successful, it will push the changes to the main branch.

If there are any errors during the build or test process, the workflow will stop the push and provide a log message with details on the error.
Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, please create a pull request with your changes. We welcome all contributions!
 
the code qwill do this steps: 
 
Sure, here's a breakdown of each step in the YAML file:

Step 1: Checkout code

This step checks out the code from the repository to the runner, so that the workflow can access it.

Step 2: Set up Node.js environment

This step sets up the Node.js environment on the runner, using the specified version of Node.js.
Step 3: Install project dependencies

This step installs the project dependencies by running the "npm install" command.
Step 4: Build the project

This step builds the project by running the "npm run build" command.
Step 5: Run tests

This step runs the tests for the project by running the "npm test" command.
Step 6: Check for updates

This step checks if there are any updates to the codebase by comparing the local repository with the remote repository.
Step 7: Wait for confirmation

This step waits for 60 seconds and prompts the user for confirmation before proceeding with the deployment.
Step 8: Deploy the project using SSH

This step deploys the project to the server using SSH and the rsync command with the specified arguments.
Step 9: Log the result

This step logs a success message if the workflow was successful.
Step 10: Send error log message

This step logs an error message if the workflow failed.
For the Backup job, there are three steps:

Step 1: Checkout code

This step checks out the code from the repository to the runner, so that the workflow can access it.
Step 2: Backup files

This step connects to the server via SSH and runs the backup script stored in the repository.
Step 3: Delete old backups

This step connects to the server via SSH and deletes old backup files using the "find" command, then commits and pushes any changes to the repository.

backup system : 

#!/bin/bash
today=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d") # set the current date in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD"
sudo tar -czvf /backup/backup-$today.tar.gz /path/to/backup/files # create a compressed archive of the backup files and save it to /backup/backup-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz



The backup.sh script creates a compressed archive of the backup files and saves it to /backup/backup-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz, where YYYY-MM-DD is the current date in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD". This script should be located at /path/to/repo/backup.sh on the server that the yaml file is running on.

To connect the yaml file to the backup.sh script, you would need to replace /path/to/repo in the yaml file with the actual path to the repository that contains the backup.sh script. You would also need to replace user@server-ip with the appropriate SSH login credentials for the server where the backup.sh script is located. Finally, make sure to update /path/to/backup/files in the backup.sh script with the actual path to the files you want to backup.
